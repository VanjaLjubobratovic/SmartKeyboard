go out for some pizza and beer
the hopes of a new organization
exceed the maximum speed limit
one hour is allotted for questions
questioning the wisdom of the courts
my favorite subject is psychology
wear a crown with many jewels
a duck quacks to ask for food
the postal service is very slow
every apple from every tree
obligations must be met first
burglars never leave their business card
your presentation was inspiring
you must make an appointment
these barracks are big enough
a much higher risk of getting cancer
the high waves will swamp us
they might find your comment offensive
tell a lie and your nose will grow
gun powder must be handled with care
the dow jones index has risen
labour unions know how to organize
the quick brown fox jumped
keep receipts for all your expenses
a subject one can really enjoy
why do you ask silly questions
frequently asked questions
i watched blazing saddles
an excellent way to communicate
exercise is good for the mind
